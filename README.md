# Lead Systems Engineer - NatSec
Founding Engineer role, with focus on US DoD programs and resilient MilCom

Location: Brooklyn | San Francisco | Relocation Supported
Type: Full-time | Competitive Pay + Equity
Start Date: ASAP

🧠 What You’ll Do

- Design and build resilient, real-time systems that operate in degraded, jammed, and contested environments
- Engineer across OSI layers 2–4, tuning nodes for failover, fallback comms, and distributed synchronization
- Focus on ultra-low latency, compact models, and embedded systems for low-SWaP deployments
- Deliver infrastructure that meets performance, security, and compliance standards required for DoD, IC, and FedCiv missions
- Work directly with the founding team on zero-to-one product roadmap, U.S. government contracts, and operational deployments

⚙️ What You Bring
- Must be a U.S. Citizen
- Must have prior experience working with the DoD, Intelligence Community, or U.S. federal civilian agencies
- 4+ years of engineering experience in at least one of the following:
    - Embedded Systems: C/C++, Rust, real-time OS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr), firmware, secure boot
    - AI/ML: PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow; quantization, pruning, distillation, LoRA; ONNX, TensorRT, TVM
    - Networking/Infra: packet-level tuning, fallback and redundancy, protocol-level programming
    - Strong systems-level skills, comfortable working close to hardware.
    - Experience in resource-constrained or mission-critical deployments 

🧩 Bonus
- Active or prior security clearance (TS/SCI, Secret, etc.)
- Background in MILCOM, aerospace, or IC programs (NSA, DISA, Army/Navy, etc.)
- Experience with contested networking: jamming resilience, disconnected ops, or distributed fallback comms.
- Prior work with secure radios, SDR/DSP, FPGA/SmartNIC, or embedded systems engineering + software-hardware deployment
- Publications or open-source contributions in embedded AI, networking, or secure systems
- Advanced degree (PhD or Master’s) in CS, EE, or related.
